# Vite Vanilla üç¶

This starter kit implements native browser features for prototyping:

- [Viget Modules](https://www.viget.com/articles/how-does-viget-javascript/) for:
    - Vanilla JS (now that the browser supports ESM modules)
    - Lazy-loading scripts per component via dynamic imports
    - Object-oriented, class-based pattern
- Regular ole' vanilla CSS

## Install and Setup

The intent is for this to be used with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) as a quick prototype kit. To grab a clean copy:

`degit nathanlong/vite-vanilla my-new-project`

`cd` into your new prototype, then install Vite with:

`npm install`

Then have Vite spin up a local server:

`npm run dev`

### Happy Prototyping üòé
